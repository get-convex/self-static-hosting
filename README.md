# Convex Self Static Hosting

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@get-convex%2Fself-static-hosting.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@get-convex/self-static-hosting)

A Convex component that enables self-hosting static React/Vite apps using Convex
HTTP actions and file storage. No external hosting provider required!

## Features

- 🚀 **Simple deployment** - Upload your built files directly to Convex storage
- 🔒 **Secure by default** - Upload API uses internal functions (not publicly
  accessible)
- 🔄 **SPA support** - Automatic fallback to index.html for client-side routing
- ⚡ **Smart caching** - Hashed assets get long-term caching, HTML is always
  fresh with ETag support
- 🧹 **Auto cleanup** - Old deployment files are automatically garbage collected
- ☁️ **Cloudflare ready** - One-command CDN setup with automatic cache purging
- 📦 **Zero config** - Works out of the box with Vite, Create React App, and
  other bundlers

## Installation

Install the component:

```bash
npm install github:get-convex/self-static-hosting#main
```

### Quick Start with LLM

Get comprehensive integration instructions to paste into your AI assistant:

```bash
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting init
```

This outputs all the code you need to integrate the component.

### Manual Setup

Add to your `convex/convex.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import selfStaticHosting from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting/convex.config.js";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(selfStaticHosting);

export default app;
```

## Setup

### 1. Register HTTP routes

Create or update `convex/http.ts` to serve static files:

```ts
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
import { registerStaticRoutes } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

const http = httpRouter();

// Serve static files at the root path with SPA fallback
registerStaticRoutes(http, components.selfStaticHosting);

export default http;
```

### 2. Expose upload API (internal functions)

Create a file like `convex/staticHosting.ts`:

```ts
import { exposeUploadApi } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

// These are INTERNAL functions - only callable via `npx convex run`
// NOT accessible from the public internet
export const { generateUploadUrl, recordAsset, gcOldAssets, listAssets } =
  exposeUploadApi(components.selfStaticHosting);
```

**Note:** Run `npx convex dev` at least once after setup to push your schema and
enable HTTP actions. If you see the error "This Convex deployment does not have
HTTP actions enabled", it means the Convex backend hasn't been deployed yet.

### 3. Add deploy script to package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "deploy:static": "npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod"
  }
}
```

**Important:** Use `--build` to ensure `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is set correctly for
production. Don't run `npm run build` separately before the upload command, as
that would use the dev URL from `.env.local`.

**CLI Options:**

```bash
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload [options]

Options:
  -d, --dist <path>           Path to dist directory (default: ./dist)
  -c, --component <name>      Convex component name (default: staticHosting)
      --prod                  Deploy to production Convex deployment
      --dev                   Deploy to dev deployment (default)
  -b, --build                 Run 'npm run build' with correct VITE_CONVEX_URL
      --domain <name>         Custom domain for URL output and Cloudflare cache purge
      --cloudflare-workers    Deploy to Cloudflare Workers instead of Convex storage
      --worker-name <name>    Cloudflare Worker name
  -h, --help                  Show help
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Deploy to production with automatic build (Convex storage)
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod

# Deploy to production with custom domain (also purges Cloudflare cache)
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod --domain mysite.com

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers instead
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod --cloudflare-workers --worker-name my-app

# Deploy to dev (for testing)
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build
```

### Using Non-Vite Bundlers

The CLI's `--build` flag sets `VITE_CONVEX_URL` when running your build command.
For bundlers that use different environment variable conventions, wrap your build
script to pass through the value:

**For Expo:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=${VITE_CONVEX_URL:-$EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL} npx expo export --platform web"
  }
}
```

**For Next.js:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=${VITE_CONVEX_URL:-$NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL} next build"
  }
}
```

The pattern `${VITE_CONVEX_URL:-$VAR}` uses `VITE_CONVEX_URL` if set (by the CLI),
otherwise falls back to your bundler-specific variable. This allows the CLI's
`--build` flag to work correctly while keeping your standalone `npm run build`
functional.

## Deployment

### One-Shot Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy both Convex backend and static files with a single command:

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
npx convex login
npx wrangler login  # if using Cloudflare Workers

# Deploy everything to Cloudflare Workers
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting deploy --cloudflare-workers --worker-name my-app

# Or deploy everything to Convex storage
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting deploy
```

The `deploy` command:
1. Builds frontend with production `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
2. Deploys Convex backend (`npx convex deploy`)
3. Deploys static files (to CF Workers or Convex storage)

This minimizes the inconsistency window between backend and frontend updates.

**Deploy command options:**

```bash
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting deploy [options]

Options:
  -d, --dist <path>           Path to dist directory (default: ./dist)
  -c, --component <name>      Convex component name (default: staticHosting)
      --cloudflare-workers    Deploy static files to Cloudflare Workers
      --worker-name <name>    Cloudflare Worker name
      --skip-build            Skip the build step (use existing dist)
      --skip-convex           Skip Convex backend deployment
  -h, --help                  Show help
```

Add to `package.json` for easy deployments:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting deploy --cloudflare-workers --worker-name my-app"
  }
}
```

### Manual Two-Step Deployment

If you prefer more control, deploy separately:

```bash
# Deploy Convex backend
npx convex deploy

# Deploy static files
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod
```

Your app is now live at `https://your-deployment.convex.site`

If you have a custom domain set up via Cloudflare, add `--domain`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:static": "npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod --domain mysite.com"
  }
}
```

This will show your custom domain in the output and automatically purge the
Cloudflare cache.

## Security

The upload API uses **internal functions** that can only be called via:

- `npx convex run` (requires Convex CLI authentication)
- Other Convex functions (server-side only)

This means unauthorized users **cannot** upload files to your site, even if they
know your Convex URL.

## Cloudflare Workers (Recommended)

Deploy your static files directly to Cloudflare Workers with Static Assets for
the best performance. Files are served from Cloudflare's edge network without
needing Convex storage.

### Benefits

- Files served directly from Cloudflare edge (no origin fetch)
- No Convex storage costs for static assets
- Built-in SPA routing support
- Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- Workers are created automatically on first deploy

### Quick Setup

```bash
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting setup-cloudflare
```

The wizard will ask you to choose between:
1. **Cloudflare Workers** (recommended) - Files hosted on CF edge
2. **Convex Storage + Cloudflare CDN** - Files in Convex, cached by CF

For Cloudflare Workers, the wizard will:
1. Login to Cloudflare (via wrangler)
2. Configure a worker name
3. Save configuration to `.env.local`
4. Offer to build and deploy

### Manual Setup

1. Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash
   npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod \
     --cloudflare-workers --worker-name my-app
   ```

3. Add to `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "deploy:static": "npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod --cloudflare-workers"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Set environment variable (optional, alternative to `--worker-name`):
   ```bash
   export CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_NAME=my-app
   ```

### Custom Domains

Add custom domains in the Cloudflare dashboard:
- Go to Workers & Pages → your worker → Settings → Triggers → Custom Domains

### Live Reload

The live reload feature still works with Cloudflare Workers! The CLI updates
Convex deployment info after each deploy, so connected clients get notified.

---

## CDN Setup (Convex Storage + Cloudflare)

If you prefer to keep static files in Convex storage (instead of Cloudflare
Workers), you can put Cloudflare in front as a CDN for edge caching, compression,
DDoS protection, and custom domains.

### Quick Setup

```bash
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting setup-cloudflare
```

Select option 2 (Convex Storage + Cloudflare CDN). The wizard will:

1. Login to Cloudflare (via wrangler)
2. Let you select or add a domain
3. Detect your production Convex deployment URL
4. Configure DNS (CNAME pointing to your Convex site)
5. Deploy a Cloudflare Worker to handle Host header rewriting
6. Ensure SSL/TLS mode is set to "Full" (prevents redirect loops)
7. Set up cache purge credentials
8. Offer to deploy your Convex backend and static files

Then just deploy - cache is automatically purged!

### What You Get

### Cache Behavior

| File Type                | Cache-Control            | ETag | CDN Behavior                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| `*.js`, `*.css` (hashed) | `max-age=1yr, immutable` | ✓    | Cached forever, new hash = new URL |
| `index.html`             | `must-revalidate`        | ✓    | Revalidates with 304 support       |
| Images, fonts            | `max-age=1yr, immutable` | ✓    | Cached long-term                   |

### Recommended: Use a Path Prefix

When using Cloudflare, serve static files from a dedicated path (e.g., `/app/`)
so your API routes remain unaffected:

```ts
// convex/http.ts
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
import { registerStaticRoutes } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

const http = httpRouter();

// Static files at /app/ - cached aggressively by Cloudflare
registerStaticRoutes(http, components.selfStaticHosting, {
  pathPrefix: "/app",
});

// Your API routes - different cache rules or no caching
http.route({
  path: "/api/webhook",
  method: "POST",
  handler: webhookHandler,
});

export default http;
```

This lets you configure Cloudflare Page Rules separately:

- `/app/*` → Cache Everything, Edge TTL: 1 month
- `/api/*` → Bypass Cache

Your app will be available at `https://yourdomain.com/app/`

### Setting Up Cloudflare (Manual)

If you prefer to set up manually instead of using the wizard:

1. **Add your site to Cloudflare** and update your domain's nameservers

2. **Create a CNAME record** pointing to your Convex site:

   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (or subdomain)
   Target: your-deployment.convex.site
   Proxy: Enabled (orange cloud)
   ```

3. **Deploy a Cloudflare Worker** to rewrite the Host header (required because
   Convex validates the Host header matches `*.convex.site`):

   ```js
   export default {
     async fetch(request) {
       const url = new URL(request.url);
       const convexUrl = new URL(
         url.pathname + url.search,
         "https://your-deployment.convex.site",
       );
       const headers = new Headers(request.headers);
       headers.set("Host", "your-deployment.convex.site");
       return fetch(convexUrl.toString(), {
         method: request.method,
         headers,
         body: request.body,
       });
     },
   };
   ```

   Then add a route: `yourdomain.com/*` → your worker

4. **Set SSL/TLS mode to "Full"** - This is critical! "Flexible" mode will cause
   redirect loops because Cloudflare sends HTTP to Convex, which redirects to
   HTTPS.

5. **(Optional) Add Page Rules** for fine-grained cache control:
   - `/app/assets/*` → Cache Level: Cache Everything, Edge TTL: 1 year
   - `/app/*` → Cache Level: Cache Everything, Edge TTL: 1 day

### Cache Purging

The CLI can automatically purge Cloudflare cache after deploying.

**Option 1: Use `--domain` flag (recommended)**

```bash
# First, login to Cloudflare via wrangler
npx wrangler login

# Then deploy with your domain
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod --domain mysite.com
```

The CLI will auto-detect your zone ID and purge the cache.

**Option 2: Environment variables (for CI/CD)**

If you ran `setup-cloudflare`, the credentials are saved in `.env.local`.
Otherwise, set them manually:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID="your-zone-id"
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
npx @get-convex/self-static-hosting upload --build --prod
```

To get these values:

- Zone ID: Found on your domain's overview page in Cloudflare
- API Token: Create at dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with "Cache Purge"
  permission

**Option 3: Via Convex function (for advanced CI/CD)**

Expose the cache purge action in your `convex/staticHosting.ts`:

```ts
import { exposeCachePurgeAction } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting";

export const { purgeCloudflareCache } = exposeCachePurgeAction();
```

Then call it from your CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
npx convex run staticHosting:purgeCloudflareCache \
  '{"zoneId": "...", "apiToken": "...", "purgeAll": true}'
```

## Live Reload on Deploy

Connected clients can be notified when a new deployment is available:

1. **Expose the deployment query**:

   ```ts
   import { exposeDeploymentQuery } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting";
   import { components } from "./_generated/api";

   export const { getCurrentDeployment } = exposeDeploymentQuery(
     components.selfStaticHosting,
   );
   ```

2. **Add the update banner to your app**:

   ```tsx
   import { UpdateBanner } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting/react";
   import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <UpdateBanner
           getCurrentDeployment={api.staticHosting.getCurrentDeployment}
           message="New version available!"
           buttonText="Refresh"
         />
         {/* rest of your app */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

Or use the hook for custom UI:

```tsx
import { useDeploymentUpdates } from "@get-convex/self-static-hosting/react";

const { updateAvailable, reload, dismiss } = useDeploymentUpdates(
  api.staticHosting.getCurrentDeployment,
);
```

## Configuration Options

### `registerStaticRoutes`

```ts
registerStaticRoutes(http, components.selfStaticHosting, {
  // URL prefix for static files (default: "/")
  pathPrefix: "/app",

  // Enable SPA fallback to index.html (default: true)
  spaFallback: true,
});
```

## How It Works

1. **Build Phase**: Your bundler (Vite, etc.) creates optimized files in `dist/`
2. **Upload Phase**: The upload script uses `npx convex run` to:
   - Generate signed upload URLs
   - Upload each file to Convex storage
   - Record file metadata in the component's database
   - Garbage collect files from previous deployments
3. **Serve Phase**: HTTP actions serve files from storage with:
   - Correct Content-Type headers
   - Smart cache control (immutable for hashed assets)
   - SPA fallback for client-side routing
